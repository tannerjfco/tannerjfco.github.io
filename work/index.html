	<h3>NBM Show Sites</h3>
	<img src="../images/nbmshowsites.jpg" alt="NBM Show Sites" />
	<p>National Business Media produces a lot of trade shows, and while many of their shows are put on under their <a href="http://thenbmshow.com">"The NBM Show"</a> specialty graphics show, they've also produced several trade shows focused on their automotive specialty markets, as well as many other markets in the past. The need for rapid development and launch of new sites for new trade show brands, combined with the need to replace their aging Drupal 6 sites for The NBM Show made a great use case for developing a custom Drupal 7 Install Profile.</p>
	<p>The Install Profile provides the bulk of the functionality, content architecture, and layout required to provide important information to attendees and exhibitors of the trade shows. It provides support for a trade show brand to have one or multiple events, in one or multiple locations, with custom branding and styling for each site.</p>
	<h3>NBM Pub Sites</h3>

	<p>Similar to their trade show business, National Business Media produces several magazine publications targeting a wide variety of specialty B2B markets. The websites supporting these publications sport thousands of articles on Drupal 6 and Wordpress.</p>
	<p>The redesign and relaunch of these sites resulted in an overhaul of the content structure to refocus the core content and provide an experience across devices of many shapes and sizes. The core of the site functionality is built as an install profile, providing for rapid development and launch of sites for new publication brands. The project also involved developing a repeatable data migration from legacy Drupal 6 and Wordpress sites using the Migrate module, Migrate D2D, and Wordpress Migrate.</p>
	<h3>Algiers Hookah</h3>

	<p><a href="http://algiershookah.com">Algiers</a> is a Hookah Bar &amp; Retail store in Fort Collins, Colorado. The site was redesigned to be responsive and prioritize important store information on mobile devices, as well as to provide an easy way to provide detailed information on their wide assortment of product offerings.</p>
	<h3>The NBM Network</h3>
	<p>A unique eCommerce service built with Drupal Commerce to support the specialty graphics markets that NBM operates publications and trade shows in. The service offered B2B classified listings, supplier &amp; distributor product postings, and an extensive video training library. The service is no longer online.</p>
